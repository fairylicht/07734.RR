                    Hi Nda, i made this simple page as a reminder for you, which hopefully can also cheer u up idk, well you know what they saaay, its not about being the best. Its about being better than you were yesterdayyy. And i guess thats exactly what you will be doing right now.  

I know you know this, but i‚Äôm saying it again:  Small progress is still progressss, so celebrate the little wins, because they matter!!. And alsoooo, NEVER BACK DOWN, NEVER WHATT?? (Yes, im yelling that at you.) 

Btw i know you always want to be number oneee but chill, you already are. So dont forget to take breaks and relax too. Soo yeaa hopefully, youll become the person youve always been striving to be. Btw im not sure if you still check this website, but if you do, i just wanted to tell you, if anything comes up while youre working on yourself, im only one call away if you ever need someone to talk, im all ears. Even though i know you prefer to keep things to yourself. Whatever it is, i hope youre always doing well. Surely, i miss you so much, but i know ill be okay eventually. Tons of luck for you, Ndaa. See you when i see you.
